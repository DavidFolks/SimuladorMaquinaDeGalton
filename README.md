# SimuladorMaquinaDeGalton

First of all, I followed the references provided in the task section. Then, I looked at other examples to come up with mine. It was a bit more confusing than the previous two projects because I wasn't sure whether to do it with .py or .ipynb, so I did it both ways. The part about functions was the trickiest for me because I hadn't used them in my previous two projects. I revisited Module 3 and the course module to get an idea, then I searched for more information online to complement it. Once I knew how to do it, everything else was easier. In the 'GraficaDeDatosgraficapie.ipynb' section, I did what my ucamp coach taught us, that we could use different types of graphs. I liked the pie chart, so I just had to change a few data points as we were shown, and that was it.
